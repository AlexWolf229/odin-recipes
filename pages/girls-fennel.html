            Alriiight! Bobby made this burger for that sourpuss, the Moody Foodie. But did he appreciate it? NO! Freakin' sourpuss. It's a beef 
            and lamb burger stuffed with green apple and topped with a flavorful fennel-celery slaw and a minty mayo-based dressing.<br>
            Bobby called it the 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fennel' burger. Ha! It's like I tell my kids...Mommy doesn't get drunk, she just has fun!

                <li>4 celery stalks</li>
                <li>1/4 head green cabbage</li>
                <li>1 cup mayo</li>
                <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill</li>
                <li>3/4 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>1/4 pound ground lamb</li>
                <li>1/2 cup finely diced green apple</li>
                <li>4 buns</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Put 4 cups of cold water in a large bowl and add the lemon juice.</li>
                <li>Trim the green stalks from the fennel and cut the white bulb in half. Cut out the tough cure and, using the large holes<br>
                 on a box grater, grate into thick matchsticks. Slice the celery into 1/4-inch slices. Put the fennel and celery in the cold<br>
                 lemon-water to keep it crisp.</li>
                <li>Grate the cabbage in the same way (reserving 4 whole leaves for assembling the burgers), and add to the cold lemon-water.</li>
                <li>Combine the mayo, sugar, vinegar, mint leaves, and dill in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Drain the cabbage and fennel, and mix in the mayo dressing until fully coated. Set in the fridge to keep cold.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, gently combine the beef and lamb and fold in the diced green apple. Form into 4 patties and season both<br>
                 sides with salt and pepper. Cook as usual.</li>
                <li>Build Your Burger: Bottom bun, cabbage leaf, burger, fennel-celery slaw, top bun.</li>
            </ol>
